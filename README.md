The waveform_recorder package provides a widget to show a waveform as an audio stream is being recorded in the style of recent AI chat packages.

## Usage

For this package to work, you'll need to set up the underlying `record` package according to the instructions here: https://pub.dev/packages/record#setup-permissions-and-others

The main entry point for this package is the `WaveformRecorder` widget, which requires an instance of the `WaveformRecorderController` to start/stop recording. Here's an example of using the recorder to record and then playing back the recorded audio:

```dart
TODO: update
```
